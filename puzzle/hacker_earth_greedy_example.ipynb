    "    Motu and Patlu are very good friends and they love to eat ice-creams. Once they thought of playing a game, so they bought “n” ice-creams from the market of varying heights (may be same). They arranged the ice-creams in a line in random order. Motu starts to eat ice-creams from left to right and Patlu from right to left. The heights of the ice-creams are known.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Motu eats the ice-cream as twice the speed of Patlu (that’s the secret for his health :p ). If, anyone of them is eating the ice-cream , then definitely other one cannot have that ice-cream. However, if both of them reach the same ice-cream, Motu snatches it away from Patlu (he got more power than patlu :( ) and eats it. The winner will be the one who will eat more number of ice-creams.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since, both of them are too busy in eating ice-creams they forgot to count the number of ice-creams they have already eaten. Can you help them in deciding the winner."
